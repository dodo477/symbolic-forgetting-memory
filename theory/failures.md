# Failures & Lessons (running log)

- 2025‑08‑13: Pure frequency made stale but frequent noise “immortal.”
  Fix: add utility U and semantic importance I; penalize redundancy.

- 2025‑08‑13: Over‑aggressive decay (λ too high) caused thrash.
  Fix: widen τ bands; add hysteresis to avoid frequent tier flapping.

- 2025‑08‑13: Symbolic-only compression lost nuance for creative recall.
  Fix: keep salient spans with symbols (L1+L2 bundle) for mid-tier.
