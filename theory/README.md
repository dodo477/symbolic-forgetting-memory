# 🧠 Theory — Symbolic Forgetting Memory

This folder contains the **conceptual backbone** of the project.

It's where I document:
- Architectural ideas
- Cognitive and neuroscientific inspirations
- Symbolic logic proposals
- Experimental failures and lessons
- The evolving design of the system

### 🔍 Sub-files (planned):
- `architecture.md`: Full design logic behind the system
- `memory_dynamics.md`: How decay, strength, and usage-based reinforcement work
- `failures.md`: Dead ends, broken ideas, and what they taught me
- `roadmap.md`: What I plan to build, test, or rewrite next

> ⚠️ This folder evolves over time. Early notes may contradict later insights.

Everything here is written **transparently and iteratively** — it's meant to capture a live, reflective development process.
