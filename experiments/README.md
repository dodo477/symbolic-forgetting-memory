# ðŸ§ª Experiments â€” Symbolic Forgetting Memory

This folder contains **raw exploratory code**, including:
- Minimal viable prototypes
- Embedding and recall tests
- Strength decay simulations
- Compression + decompression workflows

### ðŸ§° Conventions:
- Scripts: small, focused `.py` files testing one mechanism
- Notebooks: exploratory `.ipynb` files for visual debug / metrics
- Each file should include a brief description at the top

### ðŸ§­ Goals:
- Validate symbolic compression via vector space
- Simulate associative retrieval using FAISS or cosine distance
- Implement and test usage-based strength decay logic

This is not clean production code â€” it's an experimental playground.
